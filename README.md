# Invoice Data Extractor

### Overview
The Invoice Data Extractor is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of extracting relevant information from auto-generated invoices. This project leverages the capabilities of the GEMINI multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), known for its excellent Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities, to scan invoices and extract pertinent text. It is particularly useful in corporate environments where handling large volumes of invoices is routine, allowing for efficient data management and processing.

### Features
**Automated Text Extraction:** Utilizes Google GEMINI Multimodal LLM's OCR capabilities to identify and extract text from uploaded invoices.

**Web Interface:** A user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit where users can upload invoices, view uploads in real-time, and interact with the extracted data by posing relevant queries.

**Data Preview:** Allows users to preview uploaded invoices and the extracted information before processing, ensuring accuracy and relevancy.
